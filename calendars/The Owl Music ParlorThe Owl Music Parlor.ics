  since 2015.</p>\n<p><strong>Talk Bazaar</strong> will dance the night awa
 y with you\, sing and cry the whole car ride home\, and tuck you gently in
 to bed. Their 2024 album “WHATSPACE?” is the frenetic feeling of both 
 isolation and community\, of always trying to slow down and not knowing ho
 w to stop.</p>\n<p><strong>Frances Chang</strong> is a musician and multim
 edia artist living and performing in New York. Combining use of convention
 al instrumentation\, playful electronics\, and poetry\, her unique strain 
 of experimental songwriting deals with disrupting accepted reality. Her so
 ngs are an exercise in communication\, probing the tension between idiosyn
 cratic personal experience and the drive to understand and be understood t
 hrough a collective language. She regularly performs in NYC with Andrea Sc
 hiavelli (Eyes of Love) on bass and Liza Winter (Birthing Hips) on drums\,
  forming an elastic trio that excels in psychic communication and subverti
 ng expectations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>

 gether\, wry observations on daily life tinged with sadness at the knowled
 ge that it's all passing us by so quickly. The band varies from solo synth
 esizer to 10 piece chamber ensemble. For this special night at the Owl\, h

 e debut No Lands album was called "one of the most thrilling headphone exp
 eriences of this year" by Tome to the Weather Machine. More recently\, No 
 Lands has been joined by Molly Kerker\, who's voice and songwriting have p
 ushed the project from the electronic sounds of its earlier days into some

 While touring together in 2022\, Durham-based folk duo Viv &amp\; Riley an
 d Nashville songwriter Rachel Baiman bonded over beloved records and hours
  of van conversation. They dreamed of recording covers together\, sparked 
 by time spent harmonizing on stage. In June 2023\, producer Greg Griffith 
 (Amy Ray\, The Butchies) invited them to his Connecticut home studio with 
 no agenda beyond exploration. While they sat crosslegged\, arranging Lenno
 n Stella’s “Kissing Other People\,” Griffith quietly set up mics and
  a vintage camcorder—capturing a fully live\, magic-soaked take that set
  the tone for the project. The result: <em data-start="732" data-end="751"
 >Kissing Other PPL</em>\, an 8-track album of covers ranging from Magnolia
  Electric Co. to Joan Armatrading and Waylon Payne. With raw\, analog text
 ures and spontaneous choices—Viv switching to drums\, a wildly dissonant
  guitar solo from Baiman —the sessions prioritized feel over polish. The
  project is a celebration of collaboration and imperfection: three artists
  unlearning perfection\, embracing instinct\, and chasing the right sound 
 in the moment.</p>

 ersonal practice steeped in meditative and occult interests\, <b>Frances C
 hang</b>’s songs and poems take on an ever-changing experiential quality
  that combat songcraft’s standard operation as static object. She releas
 ed an album\, <i>support your local nihilist</i>\, in 2022. On May 13 at t
 he Owl\, she will be performing her songs with support from saxophonist Ca
 rolyn Hietter.</p>\n<p><strong>Katy Pinke’s</strong> songs are self-exam
 inations—cerebral and unsparing\, but reaching toward a more promising f
 uture. The Manhattan-based singer-songwriter\, painter\, and theater-maker
 ’s nimble soprano evokes the precision\, humor\, and melancholy of forbe
 arers like The Roches and Connie Converse. Sentences pour across verses\, 
 disrupting the symmetry of the expected verse-chorus form. Pinke released 
 her stripped-down debut self-titled album in the spring of 2024\, which Po
 pMatters describes as “somehow dreamlike but rooted in authentic\, basic
  principles of songwriting and performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Morrison
 </strong> is a songwriter from North Florida. Her piano-centered songs dep
 ict the strangeness of exploring new relationships through the lens of the
  unreal. Her last album <i>Attachment Figure </i>meditates on questions of
  identity\, femininity\, and her Southern upbringing. Influenced by the ar
 tists of Laurel Canyon\, 80’s darkwave\, and avant-garde jazz\, her musi
 c takes an experimental approach to the tradition of songwriting.</p>
