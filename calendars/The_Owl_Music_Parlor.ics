 ng Reading</strong> is a series started by writer Lance Scott Walker (<i>D
 J Screw: A Life In Slow Revolution</i>\, <i>Houston Rap Tapes</i>) in 2017
  to mark the societal shifts brought on by the new administration. The tit
 le comes from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 1962 novel <i>In Evil Hour</i>\, in
  which political corruption pits the denizens of a small town against one 
 another (not unlike what is going on in the United States). The series fea
 tures creatives of all disciplines reading work of their own that touches 
 on a central theme. With this event being the second to last ever at The O
 wl Music Parlor\, the theme has been left open to interpretation\, but as 
 usual Walker will host\, and guests for this evening will be actor/musicia
 n Kevin Corrigan (<i>Goodfellas</i>\, NY Grim) and former reporter/Democra
 tic politician Laura Curran\, along with a surprise guest or two. In 2025\
 , we are still "in evil hour\," and it's more important than ever for us t
 o come together and share our thoughts\, feelings\, and observations. Join
  us for the second to last show in this most special venue. </p>
