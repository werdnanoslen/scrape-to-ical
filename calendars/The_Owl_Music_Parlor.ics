 ad guitarist\, and music director for indie darling Bartees Strange\,<stro
 ng> Daniel Kleederman </strong>left the road\, returning and reemerging hi
 mself in the deep music community of New York. In the spring\, he released
  his debut LP - a psychedelic\, wholesome\, genre-obscuring record called\
 , Another Life. He is thrilled and honored to be making music with the bri
 lliant Sarah Pedinotti aka Lip Talk on this singular September night\, in 
 support of Kalmia’s special solo show and song share!</div>\n<div> </di
 v>\n<div><strong>Lip Talk</strong> (Sarah K. Pedinotti) is a Brooklyn-base
 d multimedia artist\, songwriter\, and producer whose work moves between p
 op songs\, experimental sound worlds\, and immersive installations like Ma
 ntis Shrimp Matrix. Her music is at once playful and deeply felt. This rar
 e solo set offers a glimpse into Lip Talk’s universe — new songs\, old
  favorites\, and a spirited song exchange with her friend Daniel Kleiderma
 n. Together\, the two share an evening of mutual support\, joy\, and sonic
  exploration.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>Kalmia Traver</strong> is
  a songwriter\, singer\, producer\, visual artist\, poet and co-bandleader
  of Kalbells and Rubblebucket. She/they/it will be performing a very speci
 al one-time only solo set of unreleased songs\, works in progress and a co
 ver or two for piano and voice with a side of alto saxophone. Listeners ca
 n expect some of her/their/it's classic sound signatures: waterfalls of th
 e heart\, rich harmonies\, pastoral wanderings\, octave leaping melodies a
 nd jokes. Plus maybe an invitation to sing along.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<d

 hile they sat crosslegged\, arranging Lennon Stella’s “Kissing Other P

 Viv switching to drums\, a wildly dissonant guitar solo from Baiman —the

 " /></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Power’s</strong> career has been one of quiet 
 growth. He has been releasing music under his own name since 2002\, all of
  it boasting a sensitive\, skewed\, delirious take on pop music. He has em
 barked on a quest to write song-based music full of color\, melody and shi
 fting harmonic puzzles.  Ryan will be performing solo.</p>\n<p><strong>Ka
 ty Pinke’s</strong> songs are self-examinations—cerebral and unsparing
 \, but reaching toward a more promising future. The Manhattan-based singer
 -songwriter\, painter\, and theater-maker’s nimble soprano evokes the pr
 ecision\, humor\, and melancholy of forbearers like The Roches and Connie 
 Converse. Sentences pour across verses\, disrupting the symmetry of the ex
 pected verse-chorus form. Pinke released her stripped-down debut self-titl
 ed album in the spring of 2024\, which PopMatters describes as “somehow 
 dreamlike but rooted in authentic\, basic principles of songwriting and pe
 rformance.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Morrison</strong> is a songwriter from No
 rth Florida. Her piano-centered songs depict the strangeness of exploring 
 new relationships through the lens of the unreal. Her last album <i>Attach
 ment Figure </i>meditates on questions of identity\, femininity\, and her 
 Southern upbringing. Influenced by the artists of Laurel Canyon\, 80’s d
 arkwave\, and avant-garde jazz\, her music takes an experimental approach 
 to the tradition of songwriting.</p>

 on of Stoller’s music. Her compositions—rooted in folk\, jazz\, and am
 bient traditions—balance storytelling lyricism with quiet intensity.</p>
 \n<p>The Rhythm Method\, known for their boundary-pushing work at the inte
 rsection of classical\, experimental\, and improvised music\, brings new t
 exture and dimension to Stoller’s songwriting. Each member of the quarte
 t contributes their own creative voice to the arrangements\, and utilizes 
 the ensemble’s robust shared practice of vocalization\, improvisation\, 
 and extended techniques in this unique collaboration. </p>\n<p>This perfo

 yle="color: #000000\;"><strong>Oropendola</strong> is the project of Broo
 klyn-based singer\, composer\, and keyboardist Joanna Schubert. Her songs
  draw from keys-based art-pop and indie-folk traditions\, moving between t
 he whimsical and the confessional\, blending playful dissonance and lyrica
 l storytelling. </span>Oropendola’s newest album Swimming is a piano-v
 ocal collection with a fierce\, almost <span class="gmail-il">confrontat
 ional intimacy</span>\, adorned in arrangements that could have been play
 ed by a small experimental band of elves\, gnomes and fairies. Harkening
  to inspirations such as Fiona Apple\, Regina Spektor\, and The Roches\, t
 he album captures Schubert’s penchant and reverence for unfettered live 
 performance. For this performance\, she will be joined by Gabby Sherba on 
 vocals\, Elizabeth LoPiccolo on vocals and flute\, and Nico Osborne on bas
 s and toy piano.</p>
