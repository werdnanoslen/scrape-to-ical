 et intensity.</p>\n<p>The Rhythm Method\, known for their boundary-pushing
  work at the intersection of classical\, experimental\, and improvised mus
 ic\, brings new texture and dimension to Stoller’s songwriting. Each mem

 >\n<p><strong>Grey MacMurray</strong> aspires to provoke joyful tears in s

 y happy to get to instigate something hopeful\, hopefully\, one more time.
  Hope to see you. </p>\n<p>Vocalist\, composer\, and producer <b>Charlot
 te Jacobs</b> makes jazz-flecked avant-pop shaped by literature as well as
  movement and visual art. Raised in her parents’ gallery in the Flanders
  countryside\, the Belgian-born artist found an affinity with contemporary
  dance as an adolescent\, motivated by choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersm
 aeker\, before making the pivot to music and studying jazz vocals at The R
 oyal Conservatory of Ghent.</p>\n<p>Her debut solo full-length album\, <i>
 a t l a s\, </i> showcases her interest in language as a tool for express
 ion and as a means of grounding her musical ideas. Spanning both Dutch and
  English\, the LP incorporates spoken language for the first time\, creati
 ng vocal dynamics that add depth and dimension.</p>\n<p>With Raf Vertessen
  on drums and Charlotte Greve on woodwinds\; live visuals by Kyle Luntz.</
 p>\n<p>In a world divided\, the music of <strong>Joshua Crumbly</strong> t
 akes the listener to a place that is uniquely unified\, not just in the st
 yles he blends but in the commonality of the emotions and ideas his songs 
 suggest. The acclaimed Bassist\, Composer\, Producer has toured and or col
 laborated / recorded with the likes of Kamasi Washington\, Cautious Clay\,
  Leon Bridges\, Terence Blanchard\, Stefon Harris\, Anthony Wilson\, Cass 
 McCombs\, Bob Dylan &amp\; Big Thief. In 2020\, Joshua distinguished himse
 lf as a soo artist with the release of his debut full length album "Rise''
  &amp\; followed up with his second LP a year later entitled "ForEver'' - 
 both of which garnered critical acclaim. "Very thoughtful\, very spare mus
 ic that… takes you on a journey in an almost spiritual way" - NPR Music.
  Joshua’s latest project an EP entitled "P.S.'' features Erik Bodin &amp
 \; Hákan Wirenstrand of Swedish Pop group\, Little Dragon\, Michael Rocke

 yle="color: #000000\;"><strong>Oropendola</strong> is the project of Broo
 klyn-based singer\, composer\, and keyboardist Joanna Schubert. Her songs
  draw from keys-based art-pop and indie-folk traditions\, moving between t
 he whimsical and the confessional\, blending playful dissonance and lyrica
 l storytelling. </span>Oropendola’s newest album Swimming is a piano-v
 ocal collection with a fierce\, almost <span class="gmail-il">confrontat
 ional intimacy</span>\, adorned in arrangements that could have been play
 ed by a small experimental band of elves\, gnomes and fairies. Harkening
  to inspirations such as Fiona Apple\, Regina Spektor\, and The Roches\, t
 he album captures Schubert’s penchant and reverence for unfettered live 
 performance. For this performance\, she will be joined by Gabby Sherba on 
 vocals\, Elizabeth LoPiccolo on vocals and flute\, and Nico Osborne on bas
 s and toy piano.</p>
