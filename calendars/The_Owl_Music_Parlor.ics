  loss\, confusion\, wonder\, and other conflicting emotions through minima

 instruments. Borey is also an avid performer of varied improvised musics. 
 Tonight\, he will be premiering new work for synthesizers and acoustic ins

 Viv switching to drums\, a wildly dissonant guitar solo from Baiman —the

 " /></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Power’s</strong> career has been one of quiet 
 growth. He has been releasing music under his own name since 2002\, all of
  it boasting a sensitive\, skewed\, delirious take on pop music. He has em
 barked on a quest to write song-based music full of color\, melody and shi
 fting harmonic puzzles.  Ryan will be performing solo.</p>\n<p><strong>Ka
 ty Pinke’s</strong> songs are self-examinations—cerebral and unsparing
 \, but reaching toward a more promising future. The Manhattan-based singer
 -songwriter\, painter\, and theater-maker’s nimble soprano evokes the pr
 ecision\, humor\, and melancholy of forbearers like The Roches and Connie 
 Converse. Sentences pour across verses\, disrupting the symmetry of the ex
 pected verse-chorus form. Pinke released her stripped-down debut self-titl
 ed album in the spring of 2024\, which PopMatters describes as “somehow 
 dreamlike but rooted in authentic\, basic principles of songwriting and pe
 rformance.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Morrison</strong> is a songwriter from No
 rth Florida. Her piano-centered songs depict the strangeness of exploring 
 new relationships through the lens of the unreal. Her last album <i>Attach
 ment Figure </i>meditates on questions of identity\, femininity\, and her 
 Southern upbringing. Influenced by the artists of Laurel Canyon\, 80’s d
 arkwave\, and avant-garde jazz\, her music takes an experimental approach 
 to the tradition of songwriting.</p>
