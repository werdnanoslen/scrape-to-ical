 alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>\n<p>While touring together in 2022\
 , Durham-based folk duo Viv &amp\; Riley and Nashville songwriter Rachel B
 aiman bonded over beloved records and hours of van conversation. They drea
 med of recording covers together\, sparked by time spent harmonizing on st
 age. In June 2023\, producer Greg Griffith (Amy Ray\, The Butchies) invite
 d them to his Connecticut home studio with no agenda beyond exploration. W
 hile they sat crosslegged\, arranging Lennon Stella’s “Kissing Other P
 eople\,” Griffith quietly set up mics and a vintage camcorder—capturin
 g a fully live\, magic-soaked take that set the tone for the project. The 
 result: <em data-start="732" data-end="751">Kissing Other PPL</em>\, an 8-
 track album of covers ranging from Magnolia Electric Co. to Joan Armatradi
 ng and Waylon Payne. With raw\, analog textures and spontaneous choices—
 Viv switching to drums\, a wildly dissonant guitar solo from Baiman —the
  sessions prioritized feel over polish. The project is a celebration of co
 llaboration and imperfection: three artists unlearning perfection\, embrac
 ing instinct\, and chasing the right sound in the moment.</p>

 " /></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Power’s</strong> career has been one of quiet 
 growth. He has been releasing music under his own name since 2002\, all of
  it boasting a sensitive\, skewed\, delirious take on pop music. He has em
 barked on a quest to write song-based music full of color\, melody and shi
 fting harmonic puzzles.  Ryan will be performing solo.</p>\n<p><strong>Ka
 ty Pinke’s</strong> songs are self-examinations—cerebral and unsparing
 \, but reaching toward a more promising future. The Manhattan-based singer
 -songwriter\, painter\, and theater-maker’s nimble soprano evokes the pr
 ecision\, humor\, and melancholy of forbearers like The Roches and Connie 
 Converse. Sentences pour across verses\, disrupting the symmetry of the ex
 pected verse-chorus form. Pinke released her stripped-down debut self-titl
 ed album in the spring of 2024\, which PopMatters describes as “somehow 
 dreamlike but rooted in authentic\, basic principles of songwriting and pe
 rformance.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Morrison</strong> is a songwriter from No
 rth Florida. Her piano-centered songs depict the strangeness of exploring 
 new relationships through the lens of the unreal. Her last album <i>Attach
 ment Figure </i>meditates on questions of identity\, femininity\, and her 
 Southern upbringing. Influenced by the artists of Laurel Canyon\, 80’s d
 arkwave\, and avant-garde jazz\, her music takes an experimental approach 
 to the tradition of songwriting.</p>

 yle="color: #000000\;"><strong>Oropendola</strong> is the project of Broo
 klyn-based singer\, composer\, and keyboardist Joanna Schubert. Her songs
  draw from keys-based art-pop and indie-folk traditions\, moving between t
 he whimsical and the confessional\, blending playful dissonance and lyrica
 l storytelling. </span>Oropendola’s newest album Swimming is a piano-v
 ocal collection with a fierce\, almost <span class="gmail-il">confrontat
 ional intimacy</span>\, adorned in arrangements that could have been play
 ed by a small experimental band of elves\, gnomes and fairies. Harkening
  to inspirations such as Fiona Apple\, Regina Spektor\, and The Roches\, t
 he album captures Schubert’s penchant and reverence for unfettered live 
 performance. For this performance\, she will be joined by Gabby Sherba on 
 vocals\, Elizabeth LoPiccolo on vocals and flute\, and Nico Osborne on bas
 s and toy piano.</p>
