 ch textures. Centered around the fundamental nature of breath as a marker 
 of time\, Sprat’s music unfolds into a patient\, dynamic\, and lush musi

 of North Narolina born guitarist\, composer\, singer-songwriter Christian 
 Cail. It has been aptly described with the prefixes (chamber\, baroque\, i

 an attempt to quilt contradictory elements into something unitary: acousti
 c/electric\, improvised/composed\, incidental/deliberate\, simple/ambitiou
 s.  It is principally a fanciful and personal attempt to write truly beau
 tiful songs\, drawing influence from Bach\, Gesualdo\, Stravinsky\, Appala
 chian folk\, mid-century exotica\, and jazz.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The live in
 strumentation typically includes guitar\, voice (Melanie Giselle)\,  viol
 in (Minnie Jordan)\, flute (Samantha Kochis)\, bass (Kevin Eichenberger)\,
  and mellotron (Nico Fennell).</p>\n</div>\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tandem Ar

 heart. Buoyed by Esther Quansah’s synth and background vox and Tyler Tin

 emons</p>\n<div class=""><strong>Worldwide Seagull</strong> is Anna Abondo
 lo’s alter ego\, where each performance unfolds on an imagined beach. In
 spired by ASMR\, the nervous system\, and storytelling\, a typical Seagull
  set explores the singer-songwriter archetype\, the confessional nature of
  performance\, and the tension between earnestness and theatricality.</div

 age. In June 2023\, producer Greg Griffith (Amy Ray\, The Butchies) invite

 hile they sat crosslegged\, arranging Lennon Stella’s “Kissing Other P

 result: <em data-start="732" data-end="751">Kissing Other PPL</em>\, an 8-
 track album of covers ranging from Magnolia Electric Co. to Joan Armatradi
 ng and Waylon Payne. With raw\, analog textures and spontaneous choices—
 Viv switching to drums\, a wildly dissonant guitar solo from Baiman —the
  sessions prioritized feel over polish. The project is a celebration of co
 llaboration and imperfection: three artists unlearning perfection\, embrac
 ing instinct\, and chasing the right sound in the moment.</p>

 " /></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Power’s</strong> career has been one of quiet 
 growth. He has been releasing music under his own name since 2002\, all of
  it boasting a sensitive\, skewed\, delirious take on pop music. He has em
 barked on a quest to write song-based music full of color\, melody and shi
 fting harmonic puzzles.  Ryan will be performing solo.</p>\n<p><strong>Ka
 ty Pinke’s</strong> songs are self-examinations—cerebral and unsparing
 \, but reaching toward a more promising future. The Manhattan-based singer
 -songwriter\, painter\, and theater-maker’s nimble soprano evokes the pr
 ecision\, humor\, and melancholy of forbearers like The Roches and Connie 
 Converse. Sentences pour across verses\, disrupting the symmetry of the ex
 pected verse-chorus form. Pinke released her stripped-down debut self-titl
 ed album in the spring of 2024\, which PopMatters describes as “somehow 
 dreamlike but rooted in authentic\, basic principles of songwriting and pe
 rformance.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Morrison</strong> is a songwriter from No
 rth Florida. Her piano-centered songs depict the strangeness of exploring 
 new relationships through the lens of the unreal. Her last album <i>Attach
 ment Figure </i>meditates on questions of identity\, femininity\, and her 
 Southern upbringing. Influenced by the artists of Laurel Canyon\, 80’s d
 arkwave\, and avant-garde jazz\, her music takes an experimental approach 
 to the tradition of songwriting.</p>
