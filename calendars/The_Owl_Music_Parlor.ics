 Michael Rocketship</strong> (née Coleman) brings a varied and colorful m
 usical life to his songs. From playing marathon cocktail piano gigs to scr
 eeching noise shows in dirty basements\, he's heard a few things. His song
 s are often a series of vignettes strung together\, wry observations on da
 ily life tinged with sadness at the knowledge that it's all passing us by 
 so quickly. The band varies from solo synthesizer to 10 piece chamber ense
 mble. For this special night at the Owl\, he'll be joined by vocalist Kati
 e Jacobson\, bassist Kurt Kotheimer and drummer Hamir Atwal. </p>\n<p>Sin
 ce 2014\,<strong> No Lands</strong> has been the musical outlet for songwr
 iter and audio engineer Michael Hammond. The debut No Lands album was call
 ed "one of the most thrilling headphone experiences of this year" by Tome 
 to the Weather Machine. More recently\, No Lands has been joined by Molly 
 Kerker\, who's voice and songwriting have pushed the project from the elec
 tronic sounds of its earlier days into something more organic and reflecti
 ve of the natural world.</p>

 , Durham-based folk duo Viv &amp\; Riley and Nashville songwriter Rachel B
 aiman bonded over beloved records and hours of van conversation. They drea
 med of recording covers together\, sparked by time spent harmonizing on st
 age. In June 2023\, producer Greg Griffith (Amy Ray\, The Butchies) invite
 d them to his Connecticut home studio with no agenda beyond exploration. W
 hile they sat crosslegged\, arranging Lennon Stella’s “Kissing Other P
 eople\,” Griffith quietly set up mics and a vintage camcorder—capturin
 g a fully live\, magic-soaked take that set the tone for the project. The 
 result: <em data-start="732" data-end="751">Kissing Other PPL</em>\, an 8-
 track album of covers ranging from Magnolia Electric Co. to Joan Armatradi
 ng and Waylon Payne. With raw\, analog textures and spontaneous choices—
 Viv switching to drums\, a wildly dissonant guitar solo from Baiman —the
  sessions prioritized feel over polish. The project is a celebration of co
 llaboration and imperfection: three artists unlearning perfection\, embrac
 ing instinct\, and chasing the right sound in the moment.</p>

 idth="441" height="294" /></p>\n<p>With a personal practice steeped in med
 itative and occult interests\, <b>Frances Chang</b>’s songs and poems ta
 ke on an ever-changing experiential quality that combat songcraft’s stan
 dard operation as static object. She released an album\, <i>support your l
 ocal nihilist</i>\, in 2022. On May 13 at the Owl\, she will be performing
  her songs with support from saxophonist Carolyn Hietter.</p>\n<p><strong>
 Katy Pinke’s</strong> songs are self-examinations—cerebral and unspari
 ng\, but reaching toward a more promising future. The Manhattan-based sing
 er-songwriter\, painter\, and theater-maker’s nimble soprano evokes the 
 precision\, humor\, and melancholy of forbearers like The Roches and Conni
 e Converse. Sentences pour across verses\, disrupting the symmetry of the 
 expected verse-chorus form. Pinke released her stripped-down debut self-ti
 tled album in the spring of 2024\, which PopMatters describes as “someho
 w dreamlike but rooted in authentic\, basic principles of songwriting and 
 performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Morrison</strong> is a songwriter from 
 North Florida. Her piano-centered songs depict the strangeness of explorin
 g new relationships through the lens of the unreal. Her last album <i>Atta
 chment Figure </i>meditates on questions of identity\, femininity\, and he
 r Southern upbringing. Influenced by the artists of Laurel Canyon\, 80’s
  darkwave\, and avant-garde jazz\, her music takes an experimental approac
 h to the tradition of songwriting.</p>
