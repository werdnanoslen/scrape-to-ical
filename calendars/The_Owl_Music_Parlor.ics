 class="">\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>American Seraphim</strong> is the project 
 of North Narolina born guitarist\, composer\, singer-songwriter Christian 
 Cail. It has been aptly described with the prefixes (chamber\, baroque\, i
 ndie\, prog\, avant) and the suffixes (folk\, country\, and rock). It’s 
 an attempt to quilt contradictory elements into something unitary: acousti
 c/electric\, improvised/composed\, incidental/deliberate\, simple/ambitiou
 s.  It is principally a fanciful and personal attempt to write truly beau
 tiful songs\, drawing influence from Bach\, Gesualdo\, Stravinsky\, Appala
 chian folk\, mid-century exotica\, and jazz.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The live in
 strumentation typically includes guitar\, voice (Melanie Giselle)\,  viol
 in (Minnie Jordan)\, flute (Samantha Kochis)\, bass (Kevin Eichenberger)\,
  and mellotron (Nico Fennell).</p>\n</div>\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tandem Ar
 ray</strong> is love songs from the murky depths of Adam Turay’s bloody 
 heart. With Judette Elliston on synths and background vox and Alfredo Colo
 n on EWI!</p>\n<div class=""><strong>Worldwide Seagull</strong> is Anna Ab
 ondolo’s alter ego\, where each performance unfolds on an imagined beach
 . Inspired by ASMR\, the nervous system\, and storytelling\, a typical Sea
 gull set explores the singer-songwriter archetype\, the confessional natur
 e of performance\, and the tension between earnestness and theatricality.<

 as ex-pats (Lance Scott Walker\, Birdlikebats\, and Nicholas Phelps)\,<str
 ong> Bull Thieves</strong> released one self-titled album before going und
 erground in 2011. Walker pivoted to work on his books about Houston hip-ho
 p (<i>Houston Rap Tapes\, DJ Screw: A Life In Slow Revolution</i>)\, the o
 ther band members relocated\, and the music slowed to a trickle. In 2024\,
  Walker fully rebooted the band with his best friend\, the artist Joan LeM
 ay (<i>Quantum Criminals: Ramblers\, Wild Gamblers\, and Other Sole Surviv
 ors From the Songs of Steely Dan</i>) playing bass\, and after a few duo s
 hows they were joined by drummer Liana Katz (Brooklyn Cyclones Surf Squad)
  at the center of a larger collective that includes collaborations with th
 e original Bull Thieves as well as Houston producers JGtheengineer and Ste
 nographer. The core trio of Walker\, LeMay\, and Katz plays a noisy grade 
 of indie rock that descends from Texas punk threaded with shoegaze and the
  rap and jazz/funk/R&amp\;B back catalogues that have informed their other
  artistic endeavors. Bull Thieves released the 7-inch "Pasture Kills" b/w 
 "Wild Own" in May 2025\, with an album\, <i>Rattlesnake &amp\; Swan</i>to 
 follow.</p>\n<div><strong>Echo Moth</strong> is an art-rock project by Yan
 a Davydova\, a singer songwriter and guitarist  whose spacious sound is i
 nfluenced by new wave\, post punk and her love for Argentinian rock.  For
 eign born and shaped by a lifetime of living  in NYC\, she found songwrit
 ing as a way of giving voice to her liminal persona  and how she sees rea
 lity through the lens of borderlessness and permanent transition.  She ha
 s been performing her songs live with Dmitry Ishenko\, who infuses her com
 positions with bass grooves\, electronic beats  and synth work influenced
  by his long association with the experimental and electronic jazz scene o
 f  NYC.</div>

 Viv switching to drums\, a wildly dissonant guitar solo from Baiman —the

 " /></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Power’s</strong> career has been one of quiet 
 growth. He has been releasing music under his own name since 2002\, all of
  it boasting a sensitive\, skewed\, delirious take on pop music. He has em
 barked on a quest to write song-based music full of color\, melody and shi
 fting harmonic puzzles.  Ryan will be performing solo.</p>\n<p><strong>Ka
 ty Pinke’s</strong> songs are self-examinations—cerebral and unsparing
 \, but reaching toward a more promising future. The Manhattan-based singer
 -songwriter\, painter\, and theater-maker’s nimble soprano evokes the pr
 ecision\, humor\, and melancholy of forbearers like The Roches and Connie 
 Converse. Sentences pour across verses\, disrupting the symmetry of the ex
 pected verse-chorus form. Pinke released her stripped-down debut self-titl
 ed album in the spring of 2024\, which PopMatters describes as “somehow 
 dreamlike but rooted in authentic\, basic principles of songwriting and pe
 rformance.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Morrison</strong> is a songwriter from No
 rth Florida. Her piano-centered songs depict the strangeness of exploring 
 new relationships through the lens of the unreal. Her last album <i>Attach
 ment Figure </i>meditates on questions of identity\, femininity\, and her 
 Southern upbringing. Influenced by the artists of Laurel Canyon\, 80’s d
 arkwave\, and avant-garde jazz\, her music takes an experimental approach 
 to the tradition of songwriting.</p>

 se Stoller and The Rhythm Method</strong> present an original interpretati
 on of Stoller’s music. Her compositions—rooted in folk\, jazz\, and am
 bient traditions—balance storytelling lyricism with quiet intensity.</p>
 \n<p>The Rhythm Method\, known for their boundary-pushing work at the inte
 rsection of classical\, experimental\, and improvised music\, brings new t
 exture and dimension to Stoller’s songwriting. Each member of the quarte
 t contributes their own creative voice to the arrangements\, and utilizes 
 the ensemble’s robust shared practice of vocalization\, improvisation\, 
 and extended techniques in this unique collaboration. </p>\n<p>This perfo
 rmance is generously funded by a grant from Brooklyn Arts Council.</p>
