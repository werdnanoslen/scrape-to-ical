 ey). Each one is an active presence in New York’s music community\, who\
 , having established their individual practices in/around the jazz traditi
 on\, has chosen to travel far beyond its prescribed borders. They embrace 
 electronics and a decidedly post-genre attitude. The weight of their colle
 ctive chops and credits reveal a high cultural standing. Yet if they’re 
 not touring or contributing to kunsthalle programming somewhere around the
  world\, you’ll find them in various DIY haunts\, playing with one anoth
 er\, friends and colleagues. Each regularly produces and curates nights\, 
 sharing sounds and ideas\, constantly uniting around the music to see what
  else can happen.</p>\n<p><b>Caroline Davis (saxophone/electronics) </b>an
 d<b> Dustin Carlson (guitar/electronics)</b> celebrate the release of thei
 r debut album\, <b>Sprites</b>. <i>Sprite</i> holds several meanings\, a f
 airy creature from old times\, a ghost\, a wild electrocurrent coming out 
 of the tops of clouds when lightning strikes\, and a repeating bitmapped i
 mage over a static background. The collaboration of these two genreless mu
 sicians fulfills each one of these definitions\, and with your presence\, 
 you will begin to see and hear them.</p>

 Viv switching to drums\, a wildly dissonant guitar solo from Baiman —the

 " /></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Power’s</strong> career has been one of quiet 
 growth. He has been releasing music under his own name since 2002\, all of

 barked on a quest to write song-based music full of color\, melody and shi
 fting harmonic puzzles.  Ryan will be performing solo.</p>\n<p><strong>Ka
 ty Pinke’s</strong> songs are self-examinations—cerebral and unsparing
 \, but reaching toward a more promising future. The Manhattan-based singer
 -songwriter\, painter\, and theater-maker’s nimble soprano evokes the pr
 ecision\, humor\, and melancholy of forbearers like The Roches and Connie 
 Converse. Sentences pour across verses\, disrupting the symmetry of the ex
 pected verse-chorus form. Pinke released her stripped-down debut self-titl
 ed album in the spring of 2024\, which PopMatters describes as “somehow 
 dreamlike but rooted in authentic\, basic principles of songwriting and pe
 rformance.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Morrison</strong> is a songwriter from No
 rth Florida. Her piano-centered songs depict the strangeness of exploring 
 new relationships through the lens of the unreal. Her last album <i>Attach
 ment Figure </i>meditates on questions of identity\, femininity\, and her 
 Southern upbringing. Influenced by the artists of Laurel Canyon\, 80’s d
 arkwave\, and avant-garde jazz\, her music takes an experimental approach 
 to the tradition of songwriting.</p>

 yle="color: #000000\;"><strong>Oropendola</strong> is the project of Broo
 klyn-based singer\, composer\, and keyboardist Joanna Schubert. Her songs
  draw from keys-based art-pop and indie-folk traditions\, moving between t
 he whimsical and the confessional\, blending playful dissonance and lyrica
 l storytelling. </span>Oropendola’s newest album Swimming is a piano-v
 ocal collection with a fierce\, almost <span class="gmail-il">confrontat
 ional intimacy</span>\, adorned in arrangements that could have been play
 ed by a small experimental band of elves\, gnomes and fairies. Harkening
  to inspirations such as Fiona Apple\, Regina Spektor\, and The Roches\, t
 he album captures Schubert’s penchant and reverence for unfettered live 
 performance. For this performance\, she will be joined by Gabby Sherba on 
 vocals\, Elizabeth LoPiccolo on vocals and flute\, and Nico Osborne on bas
 s and toy piano.</p>
